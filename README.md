# Train Station Simulation

### Introduction
This program simulates a train station management system using the linked list data structure to represent the queue of passengers waiting for a train. Each node in the linked list contains information about a passenger, including their name, destination, and arrival time. The linked list implementation allows for efficient insertion and deletion of passengers from the queue. When a passenger arrives at the station, they are added to the end of the linked list.

### Data structures used:
- Linked List: Used to represent the queue of passengers.
- Passenger struct: Used to store each passenger's name and train number.
- Head pointer: Used to point to the first passenger in the queue.

### The program offers the following features:
- Add passengers to the queue.
- Remove passengers from the queue.
- Display the queue.
- Check the status of a train.
- Add passengers at a particular seat.
- Delete passenger reservation at a particular seat.

The ability to display the current queue of passengers waiting for a train is particularly useful for monitoring the status of the queue and ensuring that trains are running on schedule. The display shows the name and train number of each passenger in the queue.

### Conclusions
This program emphasizes the use of a linked list to efficiently manage the queue of passengers at a train station. Overall, it serves as a valuable tool for managing train stations and ensuring that passengers arrive at their destinations on time. The program can handle large queues of passengers without sacrificing performance.
